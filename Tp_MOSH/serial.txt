/*
  *Blink
  *Turns on an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.
  *The circuit:
  * LED connected from digital pin 13 to ground.
  * Note: On most Arduino boards, there is already an LED on the board
  * connected to pin 13, so you don&rsquo;t need any extra components for this example.
